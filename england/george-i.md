# King George I

George I was the Elector of Hanover, located in the Holy Roman Empire. Though
German, he was a descendent of Mary Queen of Scots. Catholicism was out of
fashion in government when Queen Anne died, so George was crowned king as her
closest Protestant relative. A continental through and through, he didn't
bother to learn English. Somehow he was unpopular.
